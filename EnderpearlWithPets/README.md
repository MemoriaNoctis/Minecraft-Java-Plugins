# Enderpearl with your pets

Imagine this: you tame an animal thousands of blocks away from your base, and now you have a cute little companion :D Alas, you must walk/boat all the way back to your base because Minecraft doesn't allow you to teleport with your pets :(
<br><br>
This plugin solves that problem. Just put your animals (tamed or feral) on a lead and throw the pearl; your pets are sure to follow you when you land. Just to be safe, your pets will be allotted 3 seconds of invulnerability. 
<br><br>
By default, your animals will be teleported as long as they are within a 10 block radius of you, but the /radius command can alter that value within the plugin's config.yml file.
