# Respawn Teleporter Plugin

Tired of dying thousands of blocks away from your respawn and having your dropped items despawn before you can get back to them? I certainly am. 
<br><br>
This plugin stores the location of a player's last death in a hash table using player UUID. Executing the /return command teleports the command sender back to that exact location, additionally giving this player 10 seconds of invulnerability to retrieve their items and escape to safety.
